 Step 1: Worker agent generates a response to the prompt
Prompt:
The development tasks for a product typically involve breaking down each user story into smaller, actionable tasks that need to be completed in order to implement the functionality described in the story. These tasks can include activities such as coding, testing, design, documentation, and deployment. Each task should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
Worker Agent Response:
Development tasks are defined by identifying what needs to be built to implement each user story. This involves breaking down the user story into smaller, actionable tasks such as coding, testing, design, documentation, and deployment. Each task should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) to ensure successful implementation of the functionality described in the user story.
 Step 2: Evaluator agent judges the response
Evaluator Agent Evaluation:
No, the answer provided does not meet the criteria. The answer does not have the specific structure of "Task ID," "Task Title," "Related User Story," "Description," "Acceptance Criteria," "Estimated Effort," and "Dependencies" as required in the criteria provided.
 Step 3: Check if evaluation is positive
 Step 4: Generate instructions to correct the response
Instructions to fix:
To fix the incorrect answer, the worker agent should follow these guidelines to ensure the response meets the required criteria:

1. Make sure the answer includes the specific structure of:
   - Task ID
   - Task Title
   - Related User Story
   - Description
   - Acceptance Criteria
   - Estimated Effort
   - Dependencies

2. Ensure that each section is clearly labeled and filled out with the relevant information.

3. Review the original task and reformat the answer to align with the specified criteria for each section.

4. Double-check for any missing information or inaccuracies in the response before submitting the revised answer.

By following these instructions, the worker agent can provide an answer that meets the required criteria and provides a comprehensive response to the task at hand.
 Step 5: Send feedback to worker agent for refinement
