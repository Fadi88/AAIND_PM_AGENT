--- Output from Step 4: Create a development plan that includes all user stories, product features, and development tasks. ---
To fix the incorrect answer, the worker agent should provide a detailed list of tasks with the specific fields required. Each task should include the following information:

1. Task ID: A unique identifier for the task.
2. Task Title: A clear and concise title for the task.
3. Related User Story: The user story or requirement that the task is associated with.
4. Description: A detailed description of the task, outlining what needs to be done.
5. Acceptance Criteria: The criteria that must be met for the task to be considered complete.
6. Estimated Effort: An estimate of the time and resources required to complete the task.
7. Dependencies: Any dependencies or prerequisites that need to be addressed before the task can be started.

By providing this specific information for each task, the worker agent will meet the criteria and provide a more accurate and detailed response.
